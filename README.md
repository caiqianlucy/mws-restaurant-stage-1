#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, it was designed for incrementally converting a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**,  a static design that lacks accessibility was converted to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. A service worker was also added to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.



### How to run the application?

1. Clone the project: $ git clone https://github.com/caiqianlucy/mws-restaurant-stage-1.

2. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
